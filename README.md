# Mood-Snap
The aim of this project is to develop a real-time facial emotion detection system using a webcam. This system will analyze the facial expressions of a person captured through the webcam and classify the emotion being expressed into one of several predefined categories, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, or neutral.
